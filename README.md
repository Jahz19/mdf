![alt text][mdf]

## Description

Few short exercices to train its capacity to code with a limit of time (1h30 by session).  

See at http://lemeilleurdevdefrance.com/ for more details.  
See statements of the coding contest 2015 at http://www.isograd.com/EN/contestsolution.php.  

The 2014 and 2015 session are availabe with my solution in Python 3.

## Use

We can write your own solution in you are a Bourne Shell :

1) Choose your session (for instance go to `2014/`).  

3) Clean in running the script `clean` to have each exercise without my solution.  

3) Choose the first exercise (`ex1-...` ).

4) Read the direction thanks to the picture `direction.png` (or with here https://github.com/glegoux/mdf/tree/master/2014).  

5) Write your solution in editing the file answer.py in Python 3.

6) Run your exercise with the script `launch` in the current session (for instance `2014/`).

7) If your results are correct for each `input<i>.txt`, you can go to the next exercise.

*Note :* You can put your tracks with the function `local_print()` directly. In reality, when you are executing `launch`, `main.py` is running instead of `answer.py`, see `bin/` folder.

Here a example of output after that you executed the script `launch` :
